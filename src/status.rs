// shamelessly lifted from Teepee. I tried a few schemes, this really
// does seem like the best.

/// An HTTP status code (`Status-Code` in RFC 2616).
///
/// This enum is absolutely exhaustive, covering all 500 possible values (100–599).
///
/// For HTTP/2.0, statuses belonging to the 1xx Informational class are invalid.
///
/// As this is a C‐style enum with each variant having a corresponding value, you may use the likes
/// of `Continue as u16` to retreive the value `100u16`. Normally, though, you should not need to do
/// any such thing; just use the status code as a `StatusCode`.
///
/// If you encounter a status code that you do not know how to deal with, you should treat it as the
/// `x00` status code—e.g. for code 123, treat it as 100 (Continue). This can be achieved with
/// `self.class().default_code()`:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use hyper::status::{Code123, Continue};
/// assert_eq!(Code123.class().default_code(), Continue);
/// ```
