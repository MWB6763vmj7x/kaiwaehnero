//! Lower-level Server connection API.
//!
//! The types in thie module are to provide a lower-level API based around a
//! single connection. Accepting a connection and binding it with a service
//! are not handled at this level. This module provides the building blocks to
//! customize those things externally.
//!
//! If don't have need to manage connections yourself, consider using the
//! higher-level [Server](super) API.
